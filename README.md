# NumPy-Notes
Personal NumPy notes for teaching myself and others.

I don't know how to write a readme. Currently trying
to host my Jupyter Notebook online to share what I've 
been doing with my professor. Came across JupyterHub
which does that but I didn't want to bother trying
to set one up for myself and decided to try out 
mybinder.org which automates the process.

It says to add the following lines for a badge.
